# Simple-Calculator

This simple calculator project is my attempt without any knowledge of how to build a simple calculator. It was insanley frustrating, and i'm not 100% complete yet. I have yet to add logic for the decimal button. However, I'm very happy with what i've come up with. My next steps is to completely finish the project, clean up any messy code, and then learn about other simple calculator code so that I can see what areas I need to improve in. 

As for my project, theres a function that adds the mathmatic symbols to the output and a function that adds the numbers. I've added logic that prevents the number zero being pressed multiple times unless it follows a number greater than it, and i've added logic that prevents multiple mathmatic symbols being bunched together unless there are numbers inbetween these symbols. I do have to correct the logic that allows for one negative symbol to be bunched next to all symbols at least once (for negative numbers). When the equal button is pressed, the function handles multiplication and division first. It simplfys the equation down, and then moves onto the addition and subtraction.
